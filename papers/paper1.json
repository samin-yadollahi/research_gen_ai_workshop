  "summary": "The paper critically examines how research and research data management are represented through lifecycle models in the LIS literature. By developing and applying an analytic framework to nine influential models, the authors show that while lifecycles offer clarity and practical utility, they often mask the complexity, non-linearity, and openness of real research practice. The study argues for complementing lifecycle models with alternative metaphors such as knowledge spirals and data journeys to achieve a richer understanding of research processes."
