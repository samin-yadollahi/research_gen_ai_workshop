By developing and applying an analytic framework to nine influential models, the authors show that while lifecycles offer clarity and practical utility, they often mask the complexity, non-linearity, and openness of real research practice. The study argues for complementing lifecycle models with alternative metaphors such as knowledge spirals and data journeys to achieve a richer understanding of research processes.",paper1.json
